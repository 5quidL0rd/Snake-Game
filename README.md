# Snake-Game
This is a basic snake game with a bit of a twist. There are two blocks on the screen at any time but your snake can only consume one; the other is a decoy that. The score will update in a Fibonacci Sequence inspired way as well. If you happen to run into yourself or into the wall the game will end with a slightly annoying alert that informs you as much.
